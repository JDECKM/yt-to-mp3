1. Make sure you have the python library youtube_dl
2. If you do not it can be installed using:
Linux - sudo youtube-dl -U
Windows - pip install youtube_dl
3. Once it opens it asks for a youtube video URL enter it and press enter
4. It will download the video audio and will open the save location

Note it will sometime give errors but it will still work
